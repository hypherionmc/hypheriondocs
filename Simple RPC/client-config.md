title: Configuring the Mod
order: c
---
!!!info
These docs only apply to Simple RPC 3.0 and up. If you are still using one of the older versions, see [Simple RPC Legacy](/simple-rpc-legacy/client-config)
!!!

!!!danger 
Simple RPC now includes a basic in-game config screen, that is available when Cloth Config is installed. You can find the button at the TOP right corner of the OPTIONS screen. This config screen does not yet support Buttons, or Dimension Overrides. It's still suggested to use our [Config Editor App](https://github.com/hypherionmc/simple-rpc-editor/releases/). It includes Live preview and fetches the available images directly from discord!
!!!

||| Information
Simple RPC uses a universal TOML based config system, with a well named Layout and comments. You can use the same config file on Forge/Fabric, without having to redo it.

In addition to the basic Rich Presence options, the mod also includes features such as Server Side config Overrides, Defining a custom Rich Presence based on the server you're connected to as well as including a translated Rich Presence, based on the language of the player.

!!!danger
You do not need to restart the game while editing the config. The config will AUTO RELOAD when the file is saved
!!!

### Understanding the Configs

!!!info
You can also use Direct links to PNG images to use as "image keys". To do this, upload your image to a site like IMGUR, Dropbox or Github and right click the image, then copy URL. If you paste this URL into your browser and ONLY see the image, it will work. If you see a webpage, it will NOT work!
!!!

+++ Default Config

This is the default config, generated by the mod when you run it for the first time. To have a value ignored, just leave it blank. ApplicationID is required though.

+++ Translated Config
Simple RPC allows for language detection in Minecraft, so If you decide you wanna play Minecraft in a different language, your discord status can now be shown in that language. But it requires some setup, which is why this section exists.

When launching the game for the first time with 1.4+ installed, you will find a new folder called `simple-rpc` inside your `.minecraft` folder. This is the folder in which you will place your translated config files.

To create a translated config file, copy `simple-rpc.toml` from your config folder to the `simple-rpc` folder. To make sure the mod loads the correct config file, you need to rename the file a bit. The new name of your file will now be `simple-rpc_lang_code.toml`.
!!!primary
To find a complete list of lang-codes, check out this site -> https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Languages.
!!!

Once you have created this file, you can change all "state", "description", "largeimagetext" and "smallimagetext" fields. You cannot translate the imagekeys!

Some name examples of languages:

* American English -> "simple-rpc-en_us.toml"
* Dutch -> "simple-rpc-nl_nl.toml"

!!!danger
Warning: Leave the default config file in english, as the mod falls back to this file when a translated file cannot be found
!!!
+++ Server Entries Overrides
Since Simple RPC Version 2.5, it's now possible to add "custom server entries", that allow you to change the Rich Presence display data based on the IP of the server you are connected to.
This allows modpack makers to include a rich presence when someone is playing on one of their official servers, instead of just having `Playing on djghksdjh`.

This file can be found in the dedicated `simple-rpc` folder and is called `server-entries.toml`. This file, like the normal config file also supports translations, so, you can for example use `server-entries-en_us.toml` for english.

This file has a very basic layout, and is easy to work with. By default, the config file looks like this:

```toml
enabled = false
version = 1
entries = []
```

To add a custom server entry, simply replace `entries = []` with the following:

```
[[entry]]
	ip = "yourserverip"
	description = "Look mom, I have a server!"
	state = "Playing on the best damn mc server ever"
	largeImageKey = "server_log"
	largeImageText = "Find us at https://myawesomeserver.com"
	smallImageKey = ""
	smallImageText = ""
```

!!!info
Please note that `ip`, has to match the IP address or url that you use to connect to the server exactly. Meaning if you connect using `server.yourdomain.com`, then you need to use that as the IP. If you use `127.0.0.1:5689`, then you need to use that as the IP
!!!

As an example, a complete config file would look like this:

```
enabled = true
version = 1

[[entry]]
	ip = "hypherionmc.me:3008"
	description = "Testing Server Overrides"
	state = "Playing on a local server"
	largeImageKey = "hypherion_2"
	largeImageText = "It works"
	smallImageKey = ""
	smallImageText = ""
```

!!!warning
Don't forget to change `enabled` to `true` to enable this config file to work!
!!!

+++ Per Biome RPC

Since Simple RPC 3.1, it's not possible to apply an RPC based on a Biome, Dimension or Both.

### Dimension Override

This is the standard config setup. To apply an RPC based on a dimension or "world", simple enter the name as `modid:dimension`.

For example: `minecraft:overworld`

```
#Dimension Information Overrides
[dimension_overrides]
	#Allows you to override the displayed values for dimensions
	enabled = false

	#The Dimensions to override
	[[dimension_overrides.dimensions]]
		#The name of the Dimension/Biome to override. FORMAT: modid:dimension or modid:biome
		name = "overworld"
		#The first line of text under the app name
		description = "%player% is in The Overworld"
		#The second line of text under the app name
		state = ""
		#The Asset ID of the image to display as the large image
		largeImageKey = "overworld"
		#The text that gets displayed when the large image is hovered
		largeImageText = "In the Overworld"
		#The Asset ID of the image to display as the small image
		smallImageKey = "mclogo"
		#The text that gets displayed when the small image is hovered
		smallImageText = "%mods% mods installed"
		#The buttons to display on Discord
		[[dimension_overrides.dimensions.buttons]]
			label = "Test Button"
			url = "https://google.com"
```

### Biome Override

This is the standard config setup. To apply an RPC based on a biome, simple enter the name as `biome:modid:dimension`.

For example: `biome:minecraft:plains`

NOTE: `biome:` is required, otherwise the mod will try to match a dimension

```
#Dimension Information Overrides
[dimension_overrides]
	#Allows you to override the displayed values for dimensions
	enabled = false

	#The Dimensions to override
	[[dimension_overrides.dimensions]]
		#The name of the Dimension/Biome to override. FORMAT: modid:dimension or modid:biome
		name = "biome:plains"
		#The first line of text under the app name
		description = "Player is feeling PLAIN"
		#The second line of text under the app name
		state = ""
		#The Asset ID of the image to display as the large image
		largeImageKey = "overworld"
		#The text that gets displayed when the large image is hovered
		largeImageText = "In the Overworld"
		#The Asset ID of the image to display as the small image
		smallImageKey = "mclogo"
		#The text that gets displayed when the small image is hovered
		smallImageText = "%mods% mods installed"
		#The buttons to display on Discord
		[[dimension_overrides.dimensions.buttons]]
			label = "Test Button"
			url = "https://google.com"
```

### Dimension & Biome Override

This is the standard config setup. To apply an RPC based on a dimension & biome, simple enter the name as `modid:dimension|modid:biome`.

For example: `minecraft:overworld|minecraft:plains`

NOTE: `|` is required. This tells the mod to match both the Biome and Dimension

```
#Dimension Information Overrides
[dimension_overrides]
	#Allows you to override the displayed values for dimensions
	enabled = false

	#The Dimensions to override
	[[dimension_overrides.dimensions]]
		#The name of the Dimension/Biome to override. FORMAT: modid:dimension or modid:biome
		name = "overwold|plains"
		#The first line of text under the app name
		description = "Player is feeling PLAIN"
		#The second line of text under the app name
		state = ""
		#The Asset ID of the image to display as the large image
		largeImageKey = "overworld"
		#The text that gets displayed when the large image is hovered
		largeImageText = "In the Overworld"
		#The Asset ID of the image to display as the small image
		smallImageKey = "mclogo"
		#The text that gets displayed when the small image is hovered
		smallImageText = "%mods% mods installed"
		#The buttons to display on Discord
		[[dimension_overrides.dimensions.buttons]]
			label = "Test Button"
			url = "https://google.com"
```
