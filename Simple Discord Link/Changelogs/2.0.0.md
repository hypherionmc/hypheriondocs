+++ Internal Changes

* Updated to Discord JDA V5
* ERRORS are now logged as INFO, so they always show up in the MC logs

* Fixed server messages ignoring "Server Name" config option and potentially resulting in messages being sent to the wrong channels
* Fixed ignore bots settings causing all messages not to be relayed to mc

+++ New Features

* You can now "black list" commands. This means, you can ignore certain commands executed on the server from being relayed to discord
* Slash Commands! Find the bot invite link in your server log to update permissions for this
* Automatic Account Linking when whitelisting. Does not work on Admin/Moderators
* Added support for whitelisting on servers running in OFFLINE mode. (THIS IS NOT TO ENCOURAGE PIRACY!)
* Added FabricTailor Support
* Added a reload command to reload config without a server restart
* Added config option to disable channel topic updates

+++ Changes
