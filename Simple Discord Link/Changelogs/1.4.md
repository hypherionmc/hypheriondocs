**Bug Fixes**:

* Fixed whitelist list command returning incorrect data
* Fixed logger not logging errors and messages to logs
* Fixed Incorrect default values for Message Destinations
* Hopefully fixed an issue with Avatars disappearing with frequent messages. (Untested, don't have enough testers available)

**New Features**:

* Added error logging for Missing Permissions or potential incorrect discord configurations
* Added more options for Webhook and Embed player icons
* Added option to customize the Prefix for Discord -> MC messages
* You can now seperately configure Logs and Chat to either use Embeds or Plain Messages
* Configs now Hot Reload (YAY! No more restarting!). This excludes the Bot Token and Webhook Urls. These are only loaded on startup
* Add config option to customize Chat and Achievement Messages
* The bot now automatically generates and prints a BOT invite link to the console, so no need to generate it anymore

**Improvements**:

* Channel Topics now update every 6 minutes, instead of every 11 minutes (Discord Ratelimits)
