title: Configuring the Mod
---

+++ Requirements 
Before you can configure the mod, you need:

* Have a Discord Bot created and invited to your server [See Here](initial-setup.md)
* Started your server at-least once, to have the config file generated

+++ Config File Locations
* Forge/Fabric/Quilt: `config/simple-discord-bot.toml`
* Paper/Spigot/Bukkit: `plugins/SDLink/simple-discord-bot.toml`
+++

***

### Adding the required information

The very first thing to do, is to change the `botToken` field from "" to the token you copied from the previous setup. If you did not do this already or don't have a bot token, then please visit `Creating the Discord Bot`.

You can find the `botToken` in the `general` section of the config file.

AN EXAMPLE:

```
#General Mod Config
[general]
	#The Token of the Bot to use. KEEP THIS PRIVATE
	botToken = "ODcXXXg2ODA0MzkzNTAXXXXX.YRgajA.kzNCQLfGdVhKXXXie4rVC-EXXX"
```

***

#### Configuring channels

The mod allows you to configure 2 channels to send messages in. If both are configured, one will be used for Chat messages only, and the other one for everything else.

You do not need to configure both, BUT, `channelID` must always be defined. If it is not, the bot will NOT send messages from discord back to minecraft.

First make sure you have Developer mode enabled in discord. To do/check this, click the gear icon next to your discord name.

&nbsp; &nbsp;

Next, scroll down to "APP SETTINGS" and click on `Advanced`. Make sure Developer mode is enabled

After doing this, go back to your discord server, choose a channel to use for the chat and right-click on the channel name, then click `Copy ID` on the popup menu. This will copy the Channel ID required for the config to the clipboard.

Next, change `channelID` from `0` to the value you copied in the previous step. If you wish to have a separate chat and events channel, then repeat the previous step on the channel you wish to use for logging and change `logChannelID` from `0` to the copied ID.

You can leave `logChannelID` on `0`, then the mod will simply use your chat channel for everything.

!!!warning
The log channel has no effect when Webhooks are enabled
!!!

AN EXAMPLE:

```
#Chat Config
[chatConfig]
	#The ID of the channel to post in. This will be ignored if webhooks are enabled
	channelID = 123457224520163438
	#If this ID is set, event messages will be posted in this channel instead of the chat channel
	logChannelID = 123428407002800200
```

***

#### Using Webhooks

!!!warning
You still need to configure the `channelID` config value, otherwise the bot cannot relay messages from discord back to minecraft
!!!

This mod has two ways of delivering messages. You can choose which one to use. Using Channel Webhooks or using pre-configured channels. Webhooks require a bit more setup, but allows the bot to show the players' skin as the profile picture, and the player name as the name of the person that sent the message. Below is an example of a Webhook message.

![Webhook Message Example](../img/webhook-example.png)
&nbsp;

To configure this, go to a channel in Discord that you want to use for messages. Click the gear icon next to the channel name to open the channel settings. Next head over to `Integrations`.
![Integration Screen](../img/integrations.png)

To create a new webhook, click on `View Webhooks >` to open the webhooks screen.
![Webhook Screen](../img/webhooks.png)
&nbsp;

By default, discord will automatically create a new webhook if the channel does not have one. If you already have one or if a new one was created, click "Copy Webhook URL" to copy the URL to the dashboard. If you have an existing webhook, you may need to click on the webhook name to see this option.

Next, paste this URL into the config file where it says `webhookurl`. Also change `enabled` to true to make sure the bot uses webhooks. You can specify a `serverAvatar` link if you want. This is the profile picture that will be used by the bot when a message is sent from "SERVER".

AN EXAMPLE:

```
#Webhook Config
[webhookConfig]
	#Should webhook messages be used
	enabled = true
	#The URL of the channel webhook
	webhookurl = "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/123456761114300438/xxxxxxgiZCcR8Qc9v7k2lv2dWmxrWUXh35j0O8OoymC74LAGOoy8xyVU0NtU95-xxxxx"
	#The URL of the channel webhook to use for Server Messages Messages
	webhookurlLogs = "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/765432161114300438/xxxxxxgiZCcR8Qc9v7k2lv2dWmxrWUXh35j0O8OoymC74LAGOoy8xyVU0NtU95-xxxxx"
	#A DIRECT link to an image to use as the avatar for server messages
	serverAvatar = ""
```

You can now also configure another webhook to use as the for Log messages. If this is not configured, the CHAT webhook will be used for both
