![Example of a Button](../img/buttons.png)

&nbsp;  
Simple RPC 2.1+ now supports adding customizable buttons to your Rich Presence. This is useful for adding a link to your curseforge page, discord, Youtube, Website or just about anything else.
!!!primary
You can only add two buttons per section. This is a Discord Limit and not a mod limit
!!!
&nbsp;  

When loading the game the first time with 2.1+ installed, your config file will be updated, and you will find a new entry under each section of the config file. This entry is called `buttons`

By default, this entry has a value of `buttons = []`. To add your buttons, simple replace `buttons = []` to

```
# section will be either init, main_menu, etc
[[section.buttons]]
	label = "Test Button"
	url = "https://google.com
```
!!!primary
You can find a more complete example at the end of this page
!!!
!!!warning
Warning, when clicking the button on your own status from your own Discord Account, it will appear to do nothing. This is another discord limitation. To test the button, sign into a second discord account in your web browser.
!!!

&nbsp;  
You can add buttons to any section of the RPC config file, and they are hot-re loadable. Please note that if you add more than 2 buttons, the presence will fail to update.

	#The text that gets displayed when the large image is hovered
	largeImageText = "It's Minecraft %mcver%, but modded"
	#The Asset ID of the image to display as the small image
