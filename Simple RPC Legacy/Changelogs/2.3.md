**Bug Fixes:**

* Fixed Config Loading Crashes on Linux with Optifine ([#14](https://github.com/hypherionmc/simple-rpc-public/issues/14))
* Fixed Hot-Reloading not always detecting config changes

**Changes:**

* Added support for known public servers (Their details will be displayed instead of the values in the config, when using the default config file)
* Better support on %world% for Dimensions from other mods
* `world_images` changed to `dimension_overrides` and now allows you to override all display fields (except buttons). No action needed on your part
* Improvements to Debug Logging on Curseforge Launcher
* Removed support for auto-upgrading old JSON config files to TOML
* Config variables can now be used inside buttons
* Removed some unneeded libraries, reducing the mod size a bit
