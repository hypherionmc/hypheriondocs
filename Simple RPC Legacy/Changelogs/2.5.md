title: Version 2.5
order: m
---
**Changes:**

* Changed to using the OFFICIAL discord RPC API
* Massive Performance improvements:
    * Network packets are now less and sent less frequently (no longer being sent in Single Player on FORGE)
    * Launcher info is now cached and no longer fetched with each update, saving RAM and CPU usage
    * The config reloading system no longer uses constantly running threads, cutting RAM and CPU usage
    * Discord updates are now sent less frequently (Information still updates at the same speed)
    * This HOPEFULLY fixes the "phantom" ten in a million AMD lag/stuttering issues. IF YOU HAVE ISSUES, REPORT IT!
    

* Removed Update checker, because I keep forgetting to update it, so it's useless
* Added `%launchername%` and `%server%` variables
* Added a new config to allow you to add [custom server entries](../server-entries.md)

**Warning: The %serverip% variable will be removed soon! If you wish to display your server ip still, you need to add a custom server entry**

&nbsp;

**Fabric Fixes:**

* Allowed 1.18 beta to work with all snapshots

**Forge 1.17:**

* Now requires Forge 37.0.103 minimum (This is so that I can actually run it in the dev environment)
